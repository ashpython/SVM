                                         (ASSIGNMENT FOR INTERSNSHIP)
                   
CREATING A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL USING DECSION TREE REGRESSOR TO PREDICT THE QUALITY OF RED WINE ON THE BASIS OF DIFFERENT FEATURES

CALLING IMPORTANT LIBRARIES

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


IMPORTING MY DATA

redwine_data=pd.read_csv('C:/Users/baba/Desktop/winequality-red.csv')
redwine_data.columns

SELECTING MY OUTPUT VARIABLE (QUALITY OF RED WINE) DEPENDENT VARIABLES

Y=redwine_data.quality
Y

SELECTING MY FEATURES WHICH AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF RED WINE FOR PREDICTION

redwine_features=['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar',
       'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density',
       'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol']
x=redwine_data[redwine_features]
x

SPLITING MY DATA INTO 80% FOR TRAINING PART AND 20% FOR TESTING PART

train_x,val_x,train_Y,val_Y=train_test_split(x,Y,random_state=0,train_size=0.8)
redwine_model=DecisionTreeRegressor()
redwine_model.fit(train_x,train_Y)


PRINTING MY RESULTS ON THE BASIS OF MY MODEL.
HERE I AM PREDICTING TOP 5 OF MY X FEATURES

print('The Predictions using DesicionTreeRegressor For first five x inputs are')
print(x.head())
print('The predictions are')
print(redwine_model.predict(x.head()))
print(' Original outputs of quality are')
print(Y.head())

DEFINING MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR WHICH TELLS US ABOUT ACCURACY OF OUR MODEL BY TAKING THE AVERAGES OF ABSOLUTE OF DIFFERENCE OF PREDICTED AND ACTUAL OUTPUT DATA. 

mean_absolute_error(Y,redwine_model.predict(x))
